# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

**1. Observe your dat**aset

The first step to conducting exploratory data analysis is to observe your dataset at a high level. Start by determining the size of your dataset, including how many rows and columns it has. This can help you predict any future issues you might have with your data.


**2. Find any missing values**

Once you've observed your dataset, you can start looking for any missing values. When you find missing values, think about what could cause them to be missing. If you can spot a trend in your data, you might be able to replace some missing values with estimates.


**3. Categorize your values**

After you find any missing values, you can categorize your values to help determine what statistical and visualization methods can work with your dataset. You can place your values into these categories:

**Categorical:-** Categorical variables can have a set number of values.

**Continuous:-** Continuous variables can have an infinite number of values.

**Discrete:-** Discrete variables can have a set number of values that must be numeric.


**4. Find the shape of your dataset**

Finding the shape of your dataset is another important step in the EDA process. This step is important because you can gather relevant information about your dataset by observing its shape. The shape of your dataset shows your data's distribution. You can also notice data features like skewness and gaps that can help you learn more about the dataset. It can also help you identify trends in your dataset.


**5. Identify relationships in your dataset**

As you continue to understand your dataset, you can begin to pick out relationships in your dataset. Try to spot any correlations between values. Using scatter plots can make it easier to identify correlations and relationships between values. Be sure to take notes and pick out as many correlations as you can find. As you notice correlations, you can start thinking about why certain values might have correlations.


**6. Locate any outliers in your dataset**

Locating outliers in your dataset is another important step to conducting EDA. Outliers are values in your dataset that are significantly different from the rest of the values. Outliers can be much higher or lower than the other values in a dataset. It's important to identify outliers because they can skew the mean, median, mode or range of a dataset and alter the appearance of a visual representation. You can locate outliers by observing your graphs or sorting your data in numerical order during your EDA.
